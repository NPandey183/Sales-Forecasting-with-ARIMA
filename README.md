Sales Data Analysis and Forecasting
This project focuses on the analysis and forecasting of sales data using a time series approach. It leverages Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels to explore the dataset, perform sales aggregation, and build an ARIMA model for forecasting future sales trends.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named sales_data_sample.csv and contains various columns such as:

ORDERDATE: Date of sales orders
SALES: The sales value for each order
PRODUCTLINE: The category of the product sold
Preprocessing Steps:
Date Parsing: The ORDERDATE column is parsed into a proper datetime format, with error handling to manage any incorrect formats.
Missing Data Handling: Any missing values in the SALES column are forward filled to ensure the continuity of the data for time series analysis.
Analysis Performed
Sales Aggregation:

Daily sales are aggregated and plotted over time to visualize the sales trend.
Sales are also aggregated by product line to analyze performance across categories.
Time Series Forecasting:

The sales data is resampled into monthly intervals to forecast future sales.
An ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is fitted to the data.
Grid search is used to find the best parameters for the ARIMA model based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
Model Evaluation and Forecasting:

The best ARIMA model is selected, and the sales for the next 3 months are forecasted.
The model's residuals are checked to ensure the quality of the fit.
Key Files
sales_data_sample.csv: The dataset file used for analysis.
sales_forecasting.py: Python script containing the analysis and ARIMA model fitting code.
Visualizations
Daily Sales Over Time: A time series plot showing sales trends on a daily basis.
Total Sales by Product Line: A bar chart displaying total sales across different product lines.
Sales Forecast for the Next 3 Months: A plot displaying the historical data and predicted sales for the next 3 months using the ARIMA model.
Residuals Analysis: Plots of residuals and their histogram to check the goodness of fit of the model.
